Several of my colleagues and I saw there was a need to explain the insights generated from this research and to distill them into simple and practical suggestions for implementation. Our recommendations for continuous outcomes when primary interest is in unconditional treatment effect estimands, such as Average Treatment Effects (ATEs), are written up in blog form (https://stats4datascience.com/posts/covariate_adjustment/).\nFor this talk, I will discuss selected proposals from the blog that I think may be of particular interest to the working group, as well as potential areas for future work:\n\nPerformance metrics and their use in analyzing data external to a trial to select and/or construct covariates. In addition, I will discuss how these metrics provide insight into the impacts of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTEs) and strategic implications for sample size determination.\nThe concept of a model budget and suggested rules of thumb to protect the validity of statistical inference when using covariate adjustment.\nSuggestions for constructing the working regression model.\nAccounting for stratified randomization.\nFinally, I will discuss covariate adjustment of longitudinal data with continuous outcomes."

    "text": "The overarching goal of the advance sub-team is to develop and disseminate new statistical methods that address emerging challenges in covariate adjustment for randomized clinical trials (RCTs).\nIn the past five years, covariate adjustment has become increasing popular in analyzing RCTs and has also attracted great attention for methodological developments. However, the increasing complexities of real-world RCTs has outpaced the method development, leaving tons of open questions regarding covariate adjustment. For example, it remains not fully clear about the benefit of covariate adjustment and its appropriate implementation given missing data, longitudinal outcomes, time-to-event outcomes, complex trial designs, etc. These important gaps between practice and theory demand continuing efforts to deepen our understanding and develop new tools. As the statistical practice evolves, the advance sub-team aims to stay in the frontline of new techniques, results, and tools, targeting the boundary of knowledge and unopened questions.\nBearing the aim, the advance sub-team plans two kinds of activities:\n\nA monthly journal club to communicate new results regarding covariate adjustment.\nAn online forum for group-members to post/discuss questions and share resources.\n\n\n\nThe journal club takes an online format via zoom meeting and welcomes all members of the working group. Depending on the public interest, external audience can be accommodated later.\nThe journal club can take two formats: (1) roundtable discussion of an issue/question raised by group members; or (2) a seminar of recent papers presented by group members or invited external speakers. All sub-team members are encouraged to bring up roundtable topics and papers of interest through a shared Google doc, and Dr. Bingkai Wang will tentatively take the responsibilities to make schedule, invite and host speakers, and lead discussion. We do not restrict the topic of each meeting as long as it is relevant to covariate adjustment, e.g., a new method, confusions about current results, statistical software, experience sharing, etc. For each journal club meeting, we expect a warm and in-depth discussion such that new thoughts and results can be freely communicated.\n\n\n\nThe online forum serves as a platform for group members to share news, discuss questions, and post resources. In the early stage, a simple Google doc will be used to realize this function, and a formal webpage will be developed later. Dr. Bingkai Wang will tentatively maintain the forum and draft monthly newsletters summarizing the discussions for all group members.\nWe anticipate an informal and friendly forum that puts no pressure in speaking and benefits all readers. The sub-team members are especially encouraged to post thoughts and responses through the forum, aiming to warm up the forum in the early stage.\nBeyond the two activities,we also encourage offline collaborations and connections. We believe the planned activities can be a valuable opportunity to nurture new thoughts, connections, and findings. As a working group gathering worldwide talents and experts of RCTs, we have no doubt on the potential value of this platform and look forward to its powerful impact on the community."
