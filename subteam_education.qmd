# Aim and Plan

The goal of the education sub-team is to teach short-courses, develop tutorials and practical guidelines, and collect real case studies.

To reach these goals, the education sub-team plans different kinds of activities for 2024:

1.  Monthly meeting (first Monday of the month).
2.  Make short-course material that will mainly be used to teach short-courses from November 2024 onwards.
3.  A workshop (e.g., of 90min) on intro to covariate adjustment (November 2024).
4.  2-3 online blog posts on covariate adjustment. These blog posts will also be disseminated through LinkedIn.
5.  Collect possible case studies which can be used for tutorials.
